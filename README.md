# GPU Version: Approaches to Accelerating Rendering Speeds
Computational demands of rendering can be significant, especially for complex scenes with high-resolution geometric data and intricate lighting. This necessitates the development of efficient techniques to accelerate rendering speeds. In what follows, we will explore the theoretical foundations of rendering and various acceleration techniques. We will cover topics including rendering algorithms, shading calculations, acceleration data structure, optimizing ray/object intersection tests, and the impact of parallelism on rendering times. We will implement a rendering engine and investigate methods to improve its performance. We conclude by analyzing how our acceleration techniques improve the speed of our rendering engine
